It wouldn't be a GitHub project (or at least wouldn't be one of _my_ GitHub projects) if it weren't abandoned for years and then picked back up at random.

For a while now, [@chrissanders88](https://x.com/chrissanders88) has been posting "Investigation Scenarios" that present a potential security scenario (sometimes with added constraints) and ask for thoughts on how to investigate. The typically end with some variation of "What do you look for to investigate whether an incident occurred?"

The scenarios tend to spark good conversations and can include valuable guidance. I thought it might be a good idea to explore these scenarios, capture valuable guidance that different users have provided (with credit, of course), and sometimes dig a little deeper beyond "did an incident happen?"

At time of writing, I've identified 48 unique scenarios that have already been published, so there should be plenty content to keep me busy. If we're going to do that many posts, then it's probably best to start by defining a common structure to follow:

```markdown
(table of contents)

# InvestigationPath YYYYMMDD

Repeat goal.

I guess we can start with [InvestigationPath 20221108]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-10-19-investigationpath-20221108.md %})
