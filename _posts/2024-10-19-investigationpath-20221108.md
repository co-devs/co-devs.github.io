# InvestigationPath 20221108

If we take them chronologically, then the first scenario would be from 08 November 2022 ([link](https://x.com/chrissanders88/status/1589996232889360384)):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Investigation Scenario ðŸ”Ž<br><br>A workstation attempted authentication to every other Windows system on the local network.<br><br>What do you look for to start investigating this event?<br><br>Assume you have access to any evidence source you want, but no commercial EDR tools.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/InvestigationPath?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#InvestigationPath</a></p>&mdash; Chris Sanders ðŸ”Ž ðŸ§  (@chrissanders88) <a href="https://twitter.com/chrissanders88/status/1589996232889360384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

So the goal here is to identify what to look for to kick off an investigation.

## My Response

**Limitation:** No commercial EDR available.

My first thought is how do we know this happened? This could help us to determine what information is already known and provide us with some useful context to begin the investigation. The scenario doesn't provide this answer, though, and I don't want to add too much on to it, we'll assume this information came from a coworker in IT and that they can provide more information if asked.

My next thought is that this could be caused by so many different things. Before going too deep down any rabbit holes, I want to try to determine if this activity is malicious or benign. Frequently, this can be answered by asking the question "does it make sense for this resource to be doing what it's doing?"

I'd want to start off by collecting the following information:

| Info                      | Reason                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hostname                  | Basic information                                                                      |
| System Role               | Might help explain the reason for the authentications or help define potential impact  |
| Source IP Address(es)     | Basic information                                                                      |
| Username                  | Basic information                                                                      |
| User Role                 | Might help explain the reason for the authentications or help define potential impact  |
| Type of Authentication    | Might help explain the reason for the authentications and provide a useful pivot point |
| Results of Authentication | Might help explain the reason for the authentications or help define potential impact  |
| Responsible Process       | Might help explain the reason for the authentications or help define potential impact  |

If my coworker doesn't know all of the above information, then I can likely pull it from Windows event logs. The scenario doesn't tell us if we have access to the system that is conducting the authentications or only the other systems. Since EDR isn't available, it's possible that this scenario is an example of a rogue endpoint of some kind (be it a legitimate host that wasn't properly enrolled in EDR or an adversary controlled system that obtained network access).

Finally, I wonder what the timing and frequency of this activity is. Is it happening during normal business hours or after? Is it spread out or all at once? And does it appear to be happening on some kind of recurring basis. This information could point me towards a legitimate tool / service on the workstation.

### Windows Event Logs

The scenario doesn't specify whether or not the authentications were successful. If they were not, then we'd want to look at Event ID 4625 in the Security log ([link](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=4625)). If successful, then we'd want to look at Event ID 4624 in the Security log ([link](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=4624)). In this case, we don't know, so we can filter on both event IDs. We should have some information for the source host, so we can also filter on either the hostname or IP address which should appear in the `Network Information` section of both event IDs. One of the most useful pieces of information will be the `logon type`, which is logged as an integer. If the authentications are failures, then the failure reason codes may also be useful.

`Logon Process` and `Authentication Package` can also provide useful information about how the authentication was attempted. If available, the `Process Information` can also provide valuable information about what specific process was responsible for attempting the authentication. A useful resource about the information available in logon event logs is available [here](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/book/page.aspx?spid=chapter5#LogonEvents).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Many good responses -- lots of folks want to find the source process, which when examined, will reveal a lot regarding disposition.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This example and the responses demonstrate how interpreting evidence can provide different types of cues.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When possible, it&#39;s often more important to focus on the dispositional cues rather than the relational clues for the sake of expediency at the early stages of an investigation.

Further down, Chris does provide some thoughts on where this information may have come from, stating:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Likely routes are probably:<br><br>- SIEM rules triggering from Windows Event logs<br>- Threat hunting through logs looking for one-to-many relationships or large groups of success/files in a short time<br>- Observations from Windows logs made during an IR when assessing a suspect system.</p>&mdash; Chris Sanders ðŸ”Ž ðŸ§  (@chrissanders88) <a href="https://twitter.com/chrissanders88/status/1590344588593594370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
