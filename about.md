We'll see how long this one lasts.  Supposed to be a simple place to write about things that I found interesting without worrying about organization, etc.  A simple stream of consciousness.

Why `edge.scope`?  I normally use a [codeword generator](https://github.com/co-devs/codeword-generator/) when naming new projects, and that's what happened to generate for this one.  Similar to this site, the idea is to eliminate trying to come up with something clever and get straight to development.
